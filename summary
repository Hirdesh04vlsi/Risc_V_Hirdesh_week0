## ðŸ“º Week 0 â€“ Learnings

### ðŸ”¹ Video Summary 
1. **Chip Modeling (O1)**  
   - Initial specification done using C model.  
   - Testbench written in C language for functional validation.  

2. **RTL Architecture (O2)**  
   - Soft copy of hardware created in RTL (Verilog).  
   - Processor, peripherals/IPs, macros, and analog IPs are modeled.  
   
3. **SoC Integration (O3)**  
   - Components like Processor, GPIOs, and IPs are integrated at SoC level.  
   - Gate-level netlist generated and synthesized.  
   - Floorplanning, placement, CTS, and routing lead to GDSII.  
   - DRC/LVS checks ensure manufacturability.  

4. **Final Verification (O4)**  
   - At the end, outputs O1 = O2 = O3 = O4 must be consistent.  
   - This validates that chip implementation matches initial specifications.  

ðŸ“Œ Key Learning: The **SoC design flow ensures correctness from spec â†’ RTL â†’ synthesis â†’ GDSII**.
