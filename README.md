# RISC-V Hirdesh Week 0 ðŸš€

This repository is a part of the **VSD RISC-V "Silicon to Tapeout" program** by **VSD** and **Kunal Ghosh** sir.  
It documents my learning journey towards designing, verifying, and taping out a RISC-V based chip.

---

## ðŸ“– Program Overview
The program focuses on learning **VLSI SoC design flow** â€“ from chip specification, RTL coding, synthesis, floorplanning, and finally GDSII (tapeout).  

RISC-V is an **open-source Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)**, widely adopted in industry and academia because of:
- âœ… Flexibility & Custom Extensions  
- âœ… Open ecosystem (no license fees)  
- âœ… Use in low-power IoT devices, AI accelerators, microcontrollers, and high-performance CPUs  
- âœ… Backed by strong community and silicon-proven chips

## ðŸ“º Week 0 â€“ Learnings

### ðŸ”¹ Video Summary 
1. **Chip Modeling (O1)**  
   - Initial specification done using C model.  
   - Testbench written in C language for functional validation.  

2. **RTL Architecture (O2)**  
   - Soft copy of hardware created in RTL (Verilog).  
   - Processor, peripherals/IPs, macros, and analog IPs are modeled.  

3. **SoC Integration (O3)**  
   - Components like Processor, GPIOs, and IPs are integrated at SoC level.  
   - Gate-level netlist generated and synthesized.  
   - Floorplanning, placement, CTS, and routing lead to GDSII.  
   - DRC/LVS checks ensure manufacturability.

4. **Final Verification (O4)**  
   - At the end, outputs O1 = O2 = O3 = O4 must be consistent.  
   - This validates that chip implementation matches initial specifications.

ðŸ“Œ Key Learning: The **testbench is always in C language**, and the **SoC design flow ensures correctness from spec â†’ RTL â†’ synthesis â†’ GDSII**.
